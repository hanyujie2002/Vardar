# Alice in Wonderland

Alice, a young and curious girl, is sitting by a riverbank with her sister when she notices a white rabbit in a waistcoat running by, exclaiming that he is late. Intrigued, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and finds herself falling down a deep well. She lands in a strange and fantastical place called Wonderland.

Upon her arrival, Alice encounters a series of locked doors of various sizes. She finds a small key and a bottle labeled "Drink Me." After drinking from the bottle, she shrinks to a size small enough to fit through a tiny door leading to a beautiful garden. However, she realizes she left the key on the table, now out of reach. She then eats a cake labeled "Eat Me," which causes her to grow to an enormous size. Frustrated and confused, Alice begins to cry, creating a pool of tears.

As she shrinks again, she swims through her own tears and meets a mouse. The mouse tells her a story about his hatred for cats and dogs. Alice and the mouse, along with other animals, reach the shore and hold a Caucus Race to dry off. The race is chaotic and has no clear winner, but everyone is declared a winner and receives a prize.

Alice continues her journey and meets the White Rabbit again. Mistaking her for his maid, Mary Ann, he sends her to fetch his gloves and fan. Inside the rabbit's house, Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, causing her to grow so large that she gets stuck in the house. The White Rabbit and his friends try to remove her, but Alice manages to shrink back down and escape.

Wandering through the forest, Alice encounters a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom, smoking a hookah. The caterpillar gives her cryptic advice and tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow, while the other side will make her shrink. Alice breaks off two pieces of the mushroom and experiments with them until she returns to her normal size.

Alice then meets the Duchess, who is nursing a baby. The Duchess's cook is making soup with too much pepper, causing everyone to sneeze. The baby turns into a pig, and Alice lets it go. She then encounters the Cheshire Cat, who can appear and disappear at will. The Cheshire Cat directs her to the March Hare's house.

At the March Hare's house, Alice joins the March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and the Dormouse for a tea party. The tea party is chaotic and nonsensical, with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare constantly switching seats and making riddles. Frustrated by their antics, Alice leaves and continues her journey.

Alice enters the garden she saw earlier and meets the Queen of Hearts, a tyrannical ruler who constantly orders beheadings. The Queen invites Alice to play croquet, a game played with live flamingos as mallets and hedgehogs as balls. The game is chaotic, with the Queen constantly changing the rules and ordering executions.

During the game, Alice meets the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle tells her a sad story about his life and sings songs. The Gryphon and the Mock Turtle take Alice back to the Queen, who is holding a trial for the Knave of Hearts, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts.

The trial is absurd, with the jurors writing down their own names and the evidence being nonsensical. Alice grows larger and larger as the trial progresses, and she finally stands up to the Queen, declaring that the trial is a farce. The Queen orders Alice's execution, but Alice wakes up to find herself back on the riverbank with her sister.

Alice realizes that her adventures in Wonderland were just a dream, but the experience leaves her with a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around her.
